    "to get all the technologies uniform\n",
    "so doing things programmatically might've been the right call.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CAPEX (EUR/MW)`: `Nominal investment (*total)` likely to be the best candidate, although requires some tweaking to arrive at the desired `EUR/MW` values for individual heating systems and carbon capture tech.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FOM (EUR/MW/year)`: `Fixed O&M (*total) [EUR/MW_x/year]` seem easiest, although I'll need to figure out per what output we want these costs. Options for `x` seem to include `e` presumably for _electricity_, `h` presumably for _heat_, and `i` for _input_. Individual heating systems and carbon capture additions need some conversions to force into the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `VOM (EUR/MWh)`: `Variable O&M (*total) [EUR/MWh_x]`. Although carbon capture needs to be accounted for based on produced `tCO2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Lifetime`: `Technical lifetime [years]` and `Technical economic lifetime [years]` should contain what we need. Straightforward?\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Conversion Rate (output/input)`: `Electrical efficiency (net, annual average)` and `Heat efficiency (net, annual average)` should get us most of what we need, although individual heating seems to need assumptions about the heat distribution system. Accounting for carbon capture is more challenging, though. We could maybe deduce some impacts based on the `Electricity input [MWh/tCO2]` and `Heat input [MWh/tCO2]` parameters, but likely gets tricky.\n",
